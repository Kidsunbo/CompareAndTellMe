# CompareAndTellMe
A temporary script which can help me do my job as fast as possible.

## What's this

Its main purpose is help me do my job much faster than do it by hand.

The code is so tedious and follow the flow: `Get --- Search --- Found ---Next` or `Get --- Search --- Not Found --- Record`.

The Excel file which the code handles contains dozens of sheets, and in each sheet there are no less than one thousand lines of data. 

My boss asked me to find out the wrong data and record them. I did a simple calculation and found that if I did it by hand, it wouldn't be finished until I retired. So I decided to use code help me.

Finally, It did well.



## Why push it here

Well that's an interesting question. I just wanna save it as a memory or whatever. I'd just like to record it and save it. That's all :)
